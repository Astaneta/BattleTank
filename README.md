# BattleTank
## A simple project based on the Ben Tristem' Course about UE4

This project born to follow step by step the 112 lesson about building an open world tank battle. At the end of the 112th lesson, I'll start to improve the game for make it more enjoyable with new feature.

Part of the comment in the file probably in first time will be in italian (because I'm from Italy), but I'll try costantry to translate them in english
